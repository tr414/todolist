## To Do List
This is the foundation of a to do list built to help people be more productive.

## Description
At the moment, one can use this application as a simple to do list. The application will be deployed as a web app, and users can sign up and log in to access their personal task data. 
Spring Security handles user information, login, and sessions.

## Installation
Note that this deployment of the web app requires connection to a database. Credentials for the database may be saved in an 'env.properties' file in the root folder of your local version of the project, following the format of variable names found in the application.properties file in src/main/resources.


## Roadmap
Feature ideas:
Allow multiple users to be linked to 1 task to allow for group project status tracking.

Introduce categories for tasks for finer granularity in task classification beyond urgent and important

Introduce analytics to allow users to track the amount of time they spend on different tasks/categories of tasks

Introduce features to enhance user focus and/or productivity e.g. in-app Pomodoro timer, AI assistant to guide through tasks and prioritisation.
